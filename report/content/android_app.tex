\section{Android Application}
Our Android application is divided into different packages, each dedicated to a specific purpose. The separation follows the MVC model and provides a good base for the software's different parts to evolve more or less independantly from each other.

\todo{Andrea: update this}

	\item[\code{ch.ethz.inf.vs.android.g54.a4.frontend}]\hfill\\This part consists of the layout.
	\item[\code{ch.ethz.inf.vs.android.g54.a4.net}]\hfill\\Here are all the classes concerning the communication with the server, providing an interface to the other packages for requesting information. The retrieved information is then translated into convenient objects, rather than returning just the JSON objects.
	\item[\code{ch.ethz.inf.vs.android.g54.a4.logic}]\hfill\\In here is all the application logic and controlling, which relies on services of the other packages.

\subsection{Network library and Lazy Objects}
\todo{TODO: Andy, Andrea}
The network library serves as abstraction of the server's functions. All communications happen transparently to the clients (View / Controller) through asynchronous calls, allowing non-blocking loading. The model classes describe the logical structuring of the server's information in the form of lazy objects. Thus a Building object holds a reference to a possibly not yet loaded Floor object. The state of an object can be queried through the isLoaded() method and should it be necessary load its contents through the loadAsync(handler) method. The android handler will be served a message when the object is ready. All these lazy objects inherit from the LazyObject class and share the loading and caching mechanisms.
